# Sel_GNN

This repository contains the code to support the paper, for Sel_GNN. It implements a Selective GNN model for the routing packets in a network.

## Requirements
The python version used is python 3.12.2

The following python packages need to installed.
```bash
pip install numpy==1.26.4 matplotlib==3.8.4 networkx==3.3 tqdm==4.65.0 psutil==5.9.8 torch==2.2.2
```

To use the code just run any of the jupyter notebooks.
